# Persona-Non-Grata
Framework for building an interactive novel.
To be used in conjunction with a partner 'Story Editor' program, which runs in the browser, and is used to create an interactive story. 
The 'Story Editor' outputs a JSON blob, which is fed to this program. This program then constructs an interactive novel app from the user supplied story.
This is done by generating slides which contain 

-text (the story)

-several buttons (with which the user can affect his/her path through the story, in-game decisions, etc.)

-a facility for including graphics and illustrations within slides.

This is currently under development.
